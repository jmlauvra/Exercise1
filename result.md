For both cases I get a number far from 0. This number is different each time I run each program. This can be explained by that when executing the ++ or -- operations, "i" must be read, incremented and written. This can cause problems. If for say the increment operations reads the number and increments it but before it writes it back, the decrement operation reads the number that hasnt been updated, the effects of the increment operation dissapears.
